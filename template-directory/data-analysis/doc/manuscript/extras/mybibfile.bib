  shorttitle = {{{WGCNA}}},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings.
CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data. The R package along with its source code and additional material are freely available at http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA.},

  abstract = {Besides a priori approaches, using previous knowledge about food characteristics, exploratory dietary pattern (DP) methods, using data at hand, are commonly applied. This systematic literature review aimed to identify exploratory methods on DP in pan-European studies and to inform the development of the DEterminants of DIet and Physical ACtivity (DEDIPAC) toolbox of methods suitable for use in future European studies. The search was conducted in three databases on prospective studies in healthy, free-living people across the whole life span. To identify validated DP methods, an additional search without regional restrictions was conducted. Studies including at least two European countries were retained. The search resulted in six pan-European studies applying principal component/factor analysis (PC/FA) (n 5) or cluster analysis (n 2). The criteria to retain PC/factors ranged from the application of the eigenvalue {$>$}1 criterion, the scree plot and/or the interpretability criterion. Furthermore, seven validation studies were identified: DP, derived by PC/FA (n 6) or reduced rank regression (RRR) (n 1) were compared using dietary information from FFQ (n 6) or dietary history (n 1) as study instrument and dietary records (n 6) or 24-h dietary recalls (n 1) as reference. The correlation coefficients for the derived DP ranged from modest to high. To conclude, PC/FA was predominantly applied using the eigenvalue criterion and scree plot to retain DP, but a better description of the applied criteria is highly recommended to enable a standardised application of the method. Research gaps were identified for the methods cluster analysis and RRR, as well as for validation studies on DP.},

Methods and results Subjects with metabolic syndrome undergo a 18/24 week randomized intervention study comparing an isocaloric healthy Nordic diet with an average habitual Nordic diet served as control (SYSDIET study). Altogether, 68 participants are included. PBMCs are obtained before and after intervention and total RNA is subjected to global transcriptome analysis. 1302 probe sets are differentially expressed between the diet groups (p-value {$<$} 0.05). Twenty-five of these are significantly regulated (FDR q-value {$<$} 0.25) and are mainly involved in mitochondrial function, cell growth, and cell adhesion. The list of 1302 regulated probe sets is subjected to functional analyses. Pathways and processes involved in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, immune response, and cell cycle are downregulated in the healthy Nordic diet group. In addition, gene transcripts with common motifs for 42 transcription factors, including NFR1, NFR2, and NF-{$\kappa$}B, are downregulated in the healthy Nordic diet group. Conclusion These results suggest that benefits of a healthy diet may be mediated by improved mitochondrial function and reduced inflammation.},

  abstract = {We hypothesized that a common SNP in the 3' untranslated region of the upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1), rs3737787, may affect lipid traits by influencing gene expression levels, and we investigated this possibility utilizing the Mexican population, which has a high predisposition to dyslipidemia. We first associated rs3737787 genotypes in Mexican Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia (FCHL) case/control fat biopsies, with global expression patterns. To identify sets of co-expressed genes co-regulated by similar factors such as transcription factors, genetic variants, or environmental effects, we utilized weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Through WGCNA in the Mexican FCHL fat biopsies we identified two significant Triglyceride (TG)-associated co-expression modules. One of these modules was also associated with FCHL, the other FCHL component traits, and rs3737787 genotypes. This USF1-regulated FCHL-associated (URFA) module was enriched for genes involved in lipid metabolic processes. Using systems genetics procedures we identified 18 causal candidate genes in the URFA module. The FCHL causal candidate gene fatty acid desaturase 3 (FADS3) was associated with TGs in a recent Caucasian genome-wide significant association study and we replicated this association in Mexican FCHL families. Based on a USF1-regulated FCHL-associated co-expression module and SNP rs3737787, we identify a set of causal candidate genes for FCHL-related traits. We then provide evidence from two independent datasets supporting FADS3 as a causal gene for FCHL and elevated TGs in Mexicans.},

  volume = {4},
  issn = {1544-6115},
  abstract = {Gene co-expression networks are increasingly used to explore the system-level functionality of genes. The network construction is conceptually straightforward: nodes represent genes and nodes are connected if the corresponding genes are significantly co-expressed across appropriately chosen tissue samples. In reality, it is tricky to define the connections between the nodes in such networks. An important question is whether it is biologically meaningful to encode gene co-expression using binary information (connected=1, unconnected=0). We describe a general framework for ;soft' thresholding that assigns a connection weight to each gene pair. This leads us to define the notion of a weighted gene co-expression network. For soft thresholding we propose several adjacency functions that convert the co-expression measure to a connection weight. For determining the parameters of the adjacency function, we propose a biologically motivated criterion (referred to as the scale-free topology criterion). We generalize the following important network concepts to the case of weighted networks. First, we introduce several node connectivity measures and provide empirical evidence that they can be important for predicting the biological significance of a gene. Second, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that the ;weighted' topological overlap measure (used to define gene modules) leads to more cohesive modules than its ;unweighted' counterpart. Third, we generalize the clustering coefficient to weighted networks. Unlike the unweighted clustering coefficient, the weighted clustering coefficient is not inversely related to the connectivity. We provide a model that shows how an inverse relationship between clustering coefficient and connectivity arises from hard thresholding. We apply our methods to simulated data, a cancer microarray data set, and a yeast microarray data set.},

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the associations of diet quality as assessed by the Healthy Eating Index (HEI), the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), and the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) score and the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or incidence, cancer mortality or incidence, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and neurodegenerative diseases. A literature search was performed using the electronic databases MEDLINE, SCOPUS, and EMBASE with an end date of May 10, 2014. Study-specific risk ratios were pooled using a random effect model by the Cochrane software package Review Manager 5.2. Fifteen cohort studies (34 reports), including 1,020,642 subjects, met the criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. Diets of the highest quality, as assessed by the HEI, AHEI, and DASH score, resulted in a significant risk reduction (RR) for all-cause mortality (RR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.76 to 0.80; P{$<$}0.00001; I{$^2$}=61\%, 95\% CI 20\% to 81\%), cardiovascular disease (incidence or mortality) (RR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.75 to 0.81; P{$<$}0.00001; I{$^2$}=45\%, 95\% CI 13\% to 66\%), cancer (incidence or mortality) (RR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.82 to 0.88; P{$<$}0.00001; I{$^2$}=77\%, 95\% CI 68\% to 84\%), and type 2 diabetes mellitus (RR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.72 to 0.85; P{$<$}0.00001; I{$^2$}=74\%, 95\% CI 52\% to 86\%). Differences observed for neurodegenerative diseases were not significant. Egger regression tests provided no evidence of publication bias. Diets that score highly on the HEI, AHEI, and DASH are associated with a significant reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and type 2 diabetes mellitus by 22\%, 22\%, 15\%, and 22\%, respectively, and therefore is of high public health relevance.},

  volume = {109},
  issn = {1938-3207},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Replacing dietary saturated fatty acids (SFAs) with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces the plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and subsequently the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, beyond changes in LDL cholesterol, we lack a complete understanding of the physiologic alterations that occur when improving dietary fat quality.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to gain knowledge of metabolic alterations paralleling improvements in the fat quality of the diet.
METHODS: We recently conducted an 8-wk, double-blind, randomized controlled trial replacing SFAs with PUFAs in healthy subjects with moderate hypercholesterolemia (n~=~99). In the present substudy, we performed comprehensive metabolic profiling with multiple platforms (both nuclear magnetic resonance- and mass spectrometry-based technology) (n~=~99), and analyzed peripheral blood mononuclear cell gene expression (n~=~95) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.
RESULTS: A large number of lipoprotein subclasses, myristoylcarnitine and palmitoylcarnitine, and kynurenine were reduced when SFAs were replaced with PUFAs. In contrast, bile acids, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, acetate, and acetoacetate were increased by the intervention. Some amino acids were also altered by the intervention. The mRNA levels of LXRA and LDLR were increased, in addition to several liver X receptor {$\alpha$} target genes and genes involved in inflammation, whereas the mRNA levels of UCP2 and PPARD were decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells after replacing SFAs with PUFAs. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that the 30 most important variables that contributed to class separation spanned all classes of biomarkers, and was in accordance with the univariate analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Applying metabolomics in randomized controlled dietary intervention trials has the potential to extend our knowledge of the biological and molecular effects of dietary fat quality. This study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT01679496.},

However, to study to what extent such patterns capture meaningful differences in consumption of foods is of interest. In the present study, we identified important dietary patterns in Norwegian postmenopausal women (age 50\textendash{}69 years, n 361), and evaluated these patterns by examining their associations with plasma carotenoids. Diet was assessed by a 253-item FFQ. These 253 food items were categorised into forty-six food groups, and dietary patterns were identified using principal component analysis. We used the partial correlation coefficient (r
adj) and multiple linear regression analysis to examine the associations between the dietary patterns and the plasma carotenoids {$\alpha$}-carotene, {$\beta$}-carotene, {$\beta$}-cryptoxanthin, lutein, lycopene and zeaxanthin. Overall, four dietary patterns were identified: the `Western'; `Vegetarian'; `Continental'; `High-protein'. The `Western' dietary pattern scores were significantly inversely correlated with plasma lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene and total carotenoids (~-~0{$\cdot$}25~{$\leq{}~$}r
adj{$\leq{}~-~$}0{$\cdot$}13). The `Vegetarian' dietary pattern scores were significantly positively correlated with all the plasma carotenoids (0{$\cdot$}15~{$\leq{}~$}r
adj{$\leq{}~$}0{$\cdot$}24). The `Continental' dietary pattern scores were significantly inversely correlated with plasma lutein and {$\alpha$}-carotene (r
adj=~-~0{$\cdot$}13). No significant association between the `High-protein' dietary pattern scores and the plasma carotenoids was found. In conclusion, the healthy dietary pattern, the `Vegetarian' pattern, is associated with a more favourable profile of the plasma carotenoids than our unhealthy dietary patterns, the `Western' and `Continental' patterns.},

  abstract = {Dietary patterns with substantial proportions of energy from plant sources have been associated with favorable biomarkers of low-grade inflammation. Less is known of the relation between vegetarian-based dietary patterns and markers of inflammation and immune status. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the relation between vegetarian-based dietary patterns and inflammatory and immune markers (C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor {$\alpha$}, fibrinogen, natural killer cells, leukocytes, lymphocytes, thrombocytes, interleukins, and immunoglobulins). PubMed, Medline, and Cochrane scientific databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to assess the weighted mean differences (WMDs) for each outcome variable between vegetarian and non-vegetarian groups. Thirty observational and 10 intervention studies were included in the review. Pooled effects of vegetarian-based dietary patterns were associated with significantly lower concentrations of CRP (WMD: -0.61 mg/L; 95\% CI: -0.91, -0.32 mg/L; P~=~0.0001), fibrinogen (WMD: -0.22 g/L; 95\% CI: -0.41, -0.04 mg/L; P~=~0.02), and total leukocyte (WMD: -0.62~\texttimes{}~10(3)/{$\mu$}L; 95\% CI -1.13~\texttimes{}~10(3), -0.10~\texttimes{}~10(3)/{$\mu$}L; P~=~0.02) compared with those following non-vegetarian dietary patterns in observational studies. Insufficient data were identified for a meta-analysis of intervention studies. This study provides evidence that vegetarian-based dietary patterns are associated with lowered serum C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and total leukocyte concentrations. Future research should focus on large-scale intervention trials, contrasting differences in inflammation and immune status and function between vegetarian and non-vegetarian-based populations.},

  issn = {0002-9165, 1938-3207},
  abstract = {Background: Previously, a healthy Nordic diet (ND) has been shown to have beneficial health effects close to those of Mediterranean diets.
Objective: The objective was to explore whether the ND has an impact on gene expression in abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and whether changes in gene expression are associated with clinical and biochemical effects. Design: Obese adults with features of the metabolic syndrome underwent an 18- to 24-wk randomized intervention study comparing the ND with the control diet (CD) (the SYSDIET study, carried out within Nordic Centre of Excellence of the Systems Biology in Controlled Dietary Interventions and Cohort Studies). The present study included participants from 3 Nordic SYSDIET centers [Kuopio (n = 20), Lund (n = 18), and Oulu (n = 18)] with a maximum weight change of 64 kg, highly sensitive C-reactive protein concentration ,10 mg/L at the beginning and the end of the intervention, and baseline body mass index (in kg/m2) ,38. SAT biopsy specimens were obtained before and after the intervention and subjected to global transcriptome analysis with Gene 1.1 ST Arrays (Affymetrix).
Results: Altogether, 128 genes were differentially expressed in SAT between the ND and CD (nominal P , 0.01; false discovery rate, 25\%). These genes were overrepresented in pathways related to immune response (adjusted P = 0.0076), resulting mainly from slightly decreased expression in the ND and increased expression in the CD. Immune-related pathways included leukocyte trafficking and macrophage recruitment (e.g., interferon regulatory factor 1, CD97), adaptive immune response (interleukin32, interleukin 6 receptor), and reactive oxygen species (neutrophil cytosolic factor 1). Interestingly, the regulatory region of the 128 genes was overrepresented for binding sites for the nuclear transcription factor kB.
Conclusion: A healthy Nordic diet reduces inflammatory gene expression in SAT compared with a control diet independently of body weight change in individuals with features of the metabolic syndrome.

  abstract = {A healthy dietary pattern is associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) and reduced inflammation. To explore this at the molecular level, we investigated the effect of a Nordic diet (ND) on changes in the gene expression profiles of inflammatory and lipid-related genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of individuals with MetS. We hypothesized that the intake of an ND compared to a control diet (CD) would alter the expression of inflammatory genes and genes involved in lipid metabolism. The individuals with MetS underwent an 18/24-week randomized intervention to compare a ND with a CD. Eighty-eight participants (66\% women) were included in this sub-study of the larger SYSDIET study. Fasting PBMCs were collected before and after the intervention and changes in gene expression levels were measured using TaqMan Array Micro Fluidic Cards. Forty-eight pre-determined inflammatory and lipid related gene transcripts were analyzed. The expression level of the gene tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor superfamily member 1A (TNFRSF1A) was down-regulated (p = 0.004), whereas the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-{$\kappa$}B) subunit, RELA proto-oncogene, was up-regulated (p = 0.016) in the ND group compared to the CD group. In conclusion, intake of an ND in individuals with the MetS may affect immune function.},

  abstract = {Background: Healthy dietary patterns that conform to national dietary guidelines are related to lower chronic disease incidence and longer life span. However, the precise mechanisms involved are unclear. Identifying biomarkers of dietary patterns may provide tools to validate diet quality measurement and determine underlying metabolic pathways influenced by diet quality.
Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the correlation of 4 diet quality indexes [the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) 2010, the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score (aMED), the WHO Healthy Diet Indicator (HDI), and the Baltic Sea Diet (BSD)] with serum metabolites. Design: We evaluated dietary patterns and metabolites in male Finnish smokers (n = 1336) from 5 nested case-control studies within the AlphaTocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study cohort. Participants completed a validated food-frequency questionnaire and provided a fasting serum sample before study randomization (1985\textendash{}1988). Metabolites were measured with the use of mass spectrometry. We analyzed cross-sectional partial correlations of 1316 metabolites with 4 diet quality indexes, adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking, energy intake, education, and physical activity. We pooled estimates across studies with the use of fixed-effects meta-analysis with Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, and conducted metabolic pathway analyses.
Results: The HEI-2010, aMED, HDI, and BSD were associated with 23, 46, 23, and 33 metabolites, respectively (17, 21, 11, and 10 metabolites, respectively, were chemically identified; r-range: 20.30 to 0.20; P = 6 3 10215 to 8 3 1026). Food-based diet indexes (HEI-2010, aMED, and BSD) were associated with metabolites correlated with most components used to score adherence (e.g., fruit, vegetables, whole grains, fish, and unsaturated fat). HDI correlated with metabolites related to polyunsaturated fat and fiber components, but not other macro- or micronutrients (e.g., percentages of protein and cholesterol). The lysolipid and food and plant xenobiotic pathways were most strongly associated with diet quality.
Conclusions: Diet quality, measured by healthy diet indexes, is associated with serum metabolites, with the specific metabolite profile of each diet index related to the diet components used to score adherence.

  volume = {9},
  issn = {1475-2891},
  abstract = {Background: We have developed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for the assessment of habitual diet, with special focus on the intake of fruit, vegetables and other antioxidant-rich foods and beverages. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relative validity of the intakes of energy, food and nutrients from the FFQ.
Methods: Energy intake was evaluated against independent measures of energy expenditure using the ActiReg\textregistered{} system (motion detection), whereas 7-days weighed food records were used to study the relative validity of food and nutrient intake. The relationship between methods was investigated using correlation analyses and crossclassification of participants. The visual agreement between the methods was evaluated using Bland-Altman plots.
Results: We observed that the FFQ underestimated the energy intake by approximately 11\% compared to the energy expenditure measured by the ActiReg\textregistered. The correlation coefficient between energy intake and energy expenditure was 0.54 and 32\% of the participants were defined as under-reporters. Compared to the weighed food records the percentages of energy from fat and added sugar from the FFQ were underestimated, whereas the percentage of energy from total carbohydrates and protein were slightly overestimated. The intake of foods rich in antioxidants did not vary significantly between the FFQ and weighed food records, with the exceptions of berries, coffee, tea and vegetables which were overestimated. Spearman's Rank Order Correlations between FFQ and weighed food records were 0.41 for berries, 0.58 for chocolate, 0.78 for coffee, 0.61 for fruit, 0.57 for fruit and berry juices, 0.40 for nuts, 0.74 for tea, 0.38 for vegetables and 0.70 for the intake of wine.
Conclusions: Our new FFQ provides a good estimate of the average energy intake and it obtains valid data on average intake of most antioxidant-rich foods and beverages. Our study also showed that the FFQs ability to rank participants according to intake of total antioxidants and most of the antioxidant-rich foods was good.},

  volume = {36},
  issn = {0024-4201},
  abstract = {The effects of dietary trans fatty acids on serum total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol have been evaluated by incorporating trans fatty acids into predictive equations and comparing their effects with the effects of the individual saturated fatty acids 12:0, 14:0, and 16:0. Trans fatty acids from partially hydrogenated soybean oil (TRANS V) and fish oil (TRANS F) were included in previously published equations by constrained regression analysis, allowing slight adjustments of existing coefficients. Prior knowledge about the signs and ordering of the regression coefficients was explicitly incorporated into the regression modeling by adding lower and upper bounds to the coefficients. The amounts of oleic acid (18:1) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (18:2, 18:3) were not sufficiently varied in the studies, and the respective regression coefficients were therefore set equal to those found by Yu et al. [Yu, S., Derr, J., Etherton, T.D., and Kris-Etherton, P.M. (1995) Plasma Cholesterol-Predictive Equations Demonstrate That Stearic Acid Is Neutral and Monounsaturated Fatty Acids Are Hypocholesterolemic, Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 61, 1129-1139]. Stearic acid (18:0), considered to be neutral, was not included in the equations. The regression analyses were based on results from four controlled dietary studies with a total of 95 participants and including 10 diets differing in fatty acid composition and with 30-38\% of energy (E\%) as fat. The analyses resulted in the following equations, where the change in cholesterol is expressed in mmol/L and the change in intake of fatty acids is expressed in E\%: delta Total cholesterol = 0.01 delta(12:0) + 0.12 delta(14:0) + 0.057 delta(16:0) + 0.039 delta(TRANS F) + 0.031 delta(TRANS V) - 0.0044 delta(18:1) - 0.017 delta(18:2, 18:3) and deltaLDL cholesterol = 0.01 delta(12:0) + 0.071 delta(14:0) + 0.047 delta(16:0) + 0.043 delta(TRANS F) + 0.025 delta(TRANS V) - 0.0044 delta(18:1) - 0.017 delta(18:2, 18:3). The regression analyses confirm previous findings that 14:0 is the most hypercholesterolemic fatty acid and indicate that trans fatty acids are less hypercholesterolemic than the saturated fatty acids 14:0 and 16:0. TRANS F may be slightly more hypercholesterolemic than TRANS V or there may be other hypercholesterolemic fatty acids in partially hydrogenated fish oil than those included in the equations. The test set used for validation consisted of 22 data points from seven recently published dietary studies. The equation for total cholesterol showed good prediction ability with a correlation coefficient of 0.981 between observed and predicted values. The equation has been used by the Norwegian food industry in reformulating margarines into more healthful products with reduced content of cholesterol-raising fatty acids.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Cholesterol, fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins, and other lipids present in our diets are not only nutritionally important but serve as precursors for ligands that bind to receptors in the nucleus. To become biologically active, these lipids must first be absorbed by the intestine and transformed by metabolic enzymes before they are delivered to their sites of action in the body. Ultimately, the lipids must be eliminated to maintain a normal physiological state. The need to coordinate this entire lipid-based metabolic signaling cascade raises important questions regarding the mechanisms that govern these pathways. Specifically, what is the nature of communication between these bioactive lipids and their receptors, binding proteins, transporters, and metabolizing enzymes that links them physiologically and speaks to a higher level of metabolic control? Some general principles that govern the actions of this class of bioactive lipids and their nuclear receptors are considered here, and the scheme that emerges reveals a complex molecular script at work.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Nuclear receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes to affect processes as diverse as reproduction, development, and general metabolism. These proteins were first recognized as the mediators of steroid hormone signaling and provided an important link between transcriptional regulation and physiology. In the mid-1980s, the steroid receptors were cloned and found to exhibit extensive sequence similarity. The subsequent cloning of other receptor genes led to the unexpected discovery that there were many more nuclear receptor\textendash{}like genes than previously suspected. Today, the human genome is reported to contain 48 members of this transcription factor family (1). This superfamily includes not only the classic endocrine receptors that mediate the actions of steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, and the fat-soluble vitamins A and D (2), but a large number of so-called orphan nuclear receptors, whose ligands, target genes, and physiological functions were initially unknown (3). Exciting progress has been made over the last several years to elucidate the role of these orphan receptors in animal biology. Here we review recent discoveries that suggest that unlike the classic endocrine nuclear hormone receptors, many of the orphan receptors function as lipid sensors that respond to cellular lipid levels and elicit gene expression changes to ultimately protect cells from lipid overload.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The structural organization of nuclear receptors is similar despite wide variation in ligand sensitivity (Fig. 1). With few exceptions, these proteins contain an NH\textsubscript{2}-terminal region that harbors a ligand-independent transcriptional activation function (AF-1); a core DNA-binding domain, containing two highly conserved zinc finger motifs that target the receptor to specific DNA sequences known as hormone response elements; a hinge region that permits protein flexibility to allow for simultaneous receptor dimerization and DNA binding; and a large COOH-terminal region that encompasses the ligand-binding domain, dimerization interface, and a ligand-dependent activation function (AF-2). Upon ligand binding, nuclear receptors undergo a conformational change that coordinately dissociates corepressors and facilitates recruitment of coactivator proteins to enable transcriptional activation (4).{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The importance of nuclear receptors in maintaining the normal physiological state is illustrated by the enormous pharmacopoeia that has been developed to combat disorders that have inappropriate nuclear receptor signaling as a key pathological determinant. These disorders affect every field of medicine, including reproductive biology, inflammation, cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Therefore, to maintain a normal physiological state, the spatial and temporal activity of nuclear receptors must be tightly controlled by tissue-specific expression of the receptors, as well as ligand availability. Interestingly, an evaluation of the pathways involved in ligand availability reveals the existence of two distinctly different nuclear receptor paradigms.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The first paradigm is represented by the classic nuclear steroid hormone receptors (Fig. 1). Members of this group include the glucocorticoid (GR), mineralocorticoid (MR), estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), and progesterone (PR) receptors. Steroid receptors bind to DNA as homodimers, and their ligands are synthesized exclusively from endogenous endocrine sources that are regulated by negative-feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (5). After synthesis, steroid hormones are circulated in the body to their target tissues where they bind to their receptors with high affinity (dissociation constant\emph{ K}\textsubscript{d} = 0.01 to 10 nM). In vertebrates, the steroid receptor system evolved to regulate a variety of crucial metabolic and developmental events, including sexual differentiation, reproduction, carbohydrate metabolism, and electrolyte balance. The endocrine steroid receptors, their ligands, and the pathways they regulate have been the subject of decades of research, and their mechanism of action is well documented (5).{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The second nuclear receptor paradigm is represented by the adopted orphan nuclear receptors that function as heterodimers with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) (Fig. 1). Orphan receptors become adopted when they are shown to bind a physiological ligand. In contrast to the endocrine steroid receptors, the adopted orphan receptors respond to dietary lipids and, therefore, their concentrations cannot be limited by simple negative-feedback control (Fig. 2). Members of this group include receptors for fatty acids (PPARs), oxysterols (LXRs), bile acids (FXR), and xenobiotics [steroid xenobiotic receptor/pregnane X receptor (SXR/PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR)]. Furthermore, the receptors in this group bind their lipid ligands with lower affinities comparable to physiological concentrations that can be affected by dietary intake (\&gt;1 to 10 {$\mu$}M). An emerging theme regarding these receptors is that they function as lipid sensors. In keeping with this notion, ligand binding to each of these receptors activates a feedforward, metabolic cascade that maintains nutrient lipid homeostasis by governing the transcription of a common family of genes involved in lipid metabolism, storage, transport, and elimination.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}In addition to the adopted orphan receptors, there are four other RXR heterodimer receptors that do not fit precisely into either the feedforward or feedback paradigms mentioned. These include the thyroid hormone (TR), retinoic acid (RAR), vitamin D (VDR), and ecdysone (EcR) receptors (6\textendash{}9). The ligands for these four receptors and the pathways they regulate employ elements of both the endocrine and lipid-sensing receptor pathways. For example, like other RXR heterodimer ligands, both retinoic acid and ecdysone are derived from essential dietary lipids (vitamin A and cholesterol, respectively), yet they are not calorigenic and the transcriptional pathways that these ligands regulate (i.e., morphogenesis and development) more closely resemble those of the endocrine receptors. Likewise, vitamin D and thyroid hormone require exogenous elements for their synthesis (sunshine for vitamin D, iodine for thyroid hormone), yet the ultimate synthesis of these hormones and the pathways they regulate are under strict endocrine control. Thus, it is possible that these four receptors provide an evolutionary segue, spanning the gap between the endocrine receptors and the adopted orphan receptors that have recently been shown to be lipid sensors.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {We hypothesized that consumption of saturated fatty acids in the form of high-fat ground beef for 5 weeks would depress liver X receptor signaling targets in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and that changes in gene expression would be associated with the corresponding changes in lipoprotein cholesterol (C) concentrations. Older men (n = 5, age 68.0 {$\pm$} 4.6 years) and postmenopausal women (n = 7, age 60.9 {$\pm$} 3.1 years) were assigned randomly to consume ground-beef containing 18\% total fat (18F) or 25\% total fat (25F), five patties per week for 5 weeks with an intervening 4-week washout period. The 25F and 18F ground-beef increased (p {$<$} 0.05) the intake of saturated fat, monounsaturated fat, palmitic acid, and stearic acid, but the 25F ground-beef increased only the intake of oleic acid (p {$<$} 0.05). The ground-beefs 18F and 25F increased the plasma concentration of palmitic acid (p {$<$} 0.05) and decreased the plasma concentrations of arachidonic, eicosapentaenoic, and docosahexaenic acids (p {$<$} 0.05). The interventions of 18F and 25F ground-beef decreased very low-density lipoprotein C concentrations and increased particle diameters and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations (p {$<$} 0.05). The ground-beef 25F decreased PBMC mRNA levels for the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette A, ATP binding cassette G1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, and LDL receptor (LDLR) (p {$<$} 0.05). The ground-beef 18F increased mRNA levels for stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (p {$<$} 0.05). We conclude that the increased LDL particle size and LDL-I-C and LDL-II-C concentrations following the 25F ground-beef intervention may have been caused by decreased hepatic LDLR gene expression.},

  abstract = {, The long-term cholesterol-lowering effect of replacing intake of SFA with PUFA is well established, but has not been fully explained mechanistically. We examined the postprandial response of meals with different fat quality on expression of lipid genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in subjects with and without familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Thirteen subjects with FH (who had discontinued lipid-lowering treatment {$\geq$}4 weeks prior to both test days) and fourteen normolipidaemic controls were included in a randomised controlled double-blind crossover study with two meals, each with 60 g of fat either mainly SFA (about 40\% energy) or n-6 PUFA (about 40\% energy). PBMC were isolated in fasting, and 4 and 6 h postprandial blood samples. Expression of thirty-three lipid genes was analysed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR. A linear mixed model was used to assess postprandial effects between meals and groups. There was a significant interaction between meal and group for MSR1 (P = 0{$\cdot$}03), where intake of SFA compared with n-6 PUFA induced a larger reduction in gene expression in controls only (P = 0{$\cdot$}01). Intake of SFA compared with n-6 PUFA induced larger reductions in gene expression levels of LDLR and FADS1/2, smaller increases of INSIG1 and FASN, and larger increases of ABCA1 and ABCG1 (P = 0{$\cdot$}01 for all, no group interaction). Intake of SFA compared with n-6 PUFA induced changes in gene expression of cholesterol influx and efflux mediators in PBMC including lower LDLR and higher ABCA1/G1, potentially explaining the long-term cholesterol-raising effect of a high SFA intake.},

Findings highlight the role of inflammatory processes as key mediators of the association between diet and disease and point to the relevance of using blood as the target tissue in nutrigenomics. However, recurring challenges include study design issues, practical and statistical challenges, and biological interpretation of the results.

PBMCs are a promising target tissue in the field of nutrigenomics because they seem to reflect the effects of dietary modifications at the level of gene expression. In this review, we describe and discuss the scientific literature concerning the use of gene expression at the mRNA level measured from PBMCs in dietary interventions studies conducted in humans. A search of literature was undertaken using PubMed (last assessed November 24, 2011) and 20 articles were selected for discussion. Currently, results from these studies showed that PBMCs seem to reflect liver environment and complement adipose tissue findings in transcriptomics. PBMC gene expression after dietary intervention studies can be used for studying the response of certain genes related to fatty acid and cholesterol metabolism, and to explore the response of dietary interventions in relation to inflammation. However, PBMC transcriptomics from dietary intervention studies have not resulted yet in clear confirmation of candidate genes related to disease risk. Use of microarray technology in larger well-designed dietary intervention studies is still needed for exploring PBMC potential in the field of nutrigenomics.},

  volume = {60},
  issn = {1654-661X},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Research on biomarkers that provide early information about the development of future metabolic alterations is an emerging discipline. Gene expression analysis in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is a promising tool to identify subjects at risk of developing diet-related diseases.
OBJECTIVE: We analysed PBMC expression of key energy homeostasis-related genes in a time-course analysis in order to find out early markers of metabolic alterations due to sustained intake of high-fat (HF) and high-protein (HP) diets.
DESIGN: We administered HF and HP diets (4 months) to adult Wistar rats in isocaloric conditions to a control diet, mainly to avoid overweight associated with the intake of hyperlipidic diets and, thus, to be able to characterise markers of metabolically obese normal-weight (MONW) syndrome. PBMC samples were collected at different time points of dietary treatment and expression of relevant energy homeostatic genes analysed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Serum parameters related with metabolic syndrome, as well as fat deposition in liver, were also analysed.
RESULTS: The most outstanding results were those obtained for the expression of the lipolytic gene carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a (Cpt1a). Cpt1a expression in PBMC increased after only 1 month of exposure to both unbalanced diets, and this increased expression was maintained thereafter. Interestingly, in the case of the HF diet, Cpt1a expression was altered even in the absence of increased body weight but correlated with alterations such as higher insulin resistance, alteration of serum lipid profile and, particularly, increased fat deposition in liver, a feature characteristic of metabolic syndrome, which was even observed in animals fed with HP diet.
CONCLUSIONS: We propose Cpt1a gene expression analysis in PBMC as an early biomarker of metabolic alterations associated with MONW phenotype due to the intake of isocaloric HF diets, as well as a marker of increased risk of metabolic diseases associated with the intake of HF or HP diets.},
