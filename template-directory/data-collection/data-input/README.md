## Organizing data in spreadsheets

> “In what form would you like the data?” My response is always, “In its current form!” If the data need to be reformatted, it’s much better for me to write a script than for them to do a bunch of cut-and-paste.

  - Use consistent file names.
  - Use a single common format for all dates, preferably YYYY-MM-DD.
  - Use consistent phrases in your notes.
  - Be careful about extra spaces within cells.
- Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD.
- Fill in all of the cells.
- Put just one thing in a cell.
- Make it a rectangle.
- Create a data dictionary.
- No calculations in the raw data files.
- Don’t use font color or highlighting as data.
- Choose good names for things.
- Make backups.
  - Make regular backups of your data. In multiple locations.
  - Use Git.
  - When you’re not actively entering data, and particularly when you’re done entering data, write-protect the file.
- Use data validation to avoid data entry mistakes.
  - Which is a nice feature in Excel.
