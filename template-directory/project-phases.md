# Project phases

## On different phases in a research project

### Before the project

- Plan for the project.
- Generate a directory for the project.
- Design the structure of the directory.
- Apply the 5 Cs.
- Apply good practices for file naming.
- Pick a scheme for organizing data.
- Add a README.md file to the directory.

### During the project

- On daily/weekly basis, document the steps you have accomplished
- If you have done analysis or collect dataset, try to document the workflow to do this and include the scripts you have generated for featuring the data.
- For each script that does analysis, document it in another file and write what it does, the input, and the output of the script. In literate programming in Rmarkdown files, this can be documented inline.
- Choose file formats that will ensure long-term access (e.g., .txt).
- Use coding convention (e.g., module naming, comments).
- Use relative paths in the code (e.g., ../rawdata/example_file.csv).
- Use tools that help you to automate your analysis, such as R.
- Use tools that help in documenting the workflow and managing the data, such as RStudio and Rmarkdown files.
- Document each major step from the analysis.
- Backup your data files every one in a while.
- Consider use of GNU Make (Makefile) to automate the research process.
- For writing your manuscript use Rmarkdown and Bibtex.
- Use version control system such as Git.

### After the project

*Code*

- Directly after publishing a scientific paper, document the workflow of the analysis in the paper (i.e., write the steps that allow anyone to repeat the analysis):
  1. Clean the code.
  2. Add even more explanatory text.
  3. Write a README.md file that explains how to do a git branch and retrieve the repo to the state it was when the paper was published.
  4. Store a physical version of html reports at time of submission and publishing.
- Develop a clear, accurate, and precise user documentation for the project/sub-project/manuscript. This can be an elaborate version of the READMEs, so that anyone from outside can take over the project and repeat all analyses steps.
- License your software.
- Upload clean code to GitHub together with a README file and user documentation. 

*Data* 

- Deposit your data in a repository for long-term preservation.
  - Institutional Repositories: Dash or Merrit.
  - Non-institutional repositories: Figshare.
- Get your Data and your project DOIs.
- Share your project on Open Science Framework.
- If you have a sensitive data, check your institution policy to before sharing.

*Publicity*

- Log publications (presentations, posters, papers) in relevant research information systems (CRISTIN, Google Scholar ++)
- Upload post-print to CRISTIN.
- Create a presentation that summarizes the paper, if not already done. 
- Write up a short popular science summary and publish it on your personal website/blog, together with a graphical abstract. 
- Add publications to your personal CV
